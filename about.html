                        deepest
                        fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our
                        light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask
                        ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented,
                        and
                        fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a
                        child
                        of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.
                        There
                        is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other
                        people
                        will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to
                        shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the
                        glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some
                        of
                        us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine,
                        we
                        unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As
                        we
                        are liberated from our own fear, our presence
                        automatically
                        liberates others." - Marianne Williamson</h2>
